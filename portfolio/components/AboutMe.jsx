          Hello there, I'm Sami, a Full Stack Developer from London with a
          passion for transforming ideas into dynamic digital experiences. With
          a solid foundation in both front-end and back-end technologies, I
          aspire to craft seamless, user-centric applications that bridge the
          gap between form and function. My passion for technology began in my
          early years when I would disassemble my familyâ€™s computer, driven by a
          deep curiosity to understand its inner workings. Although this
          hands-on exploration occasionally led to unintended disruptions, the
          insights I gained during those formative experiences were invaluable
          and ignited my enduring interest in the field. This eventually pushed
          me to build my own computer to start my programming journey.
